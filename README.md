# Gaussian Elimination with partial pivoting

## AIM:
To write a program to find the Gaussian Elimination with partial pivoting of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
1.Import numpy
2.Import sys
3.Use nested for loop for partial pivoting
4.Print the solved matrix

## Program:
~~~
Program to find the Gaussian Elimination with partial pivoting of a matrix.
Developed by:G.Pavithra 
RegisterNumber: 21500148

CODE:
import numpy as np
import sys
n = int(input())
a = np.zeros((n,n+1))
X = np.zeros(n)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n+1):
        a[i][j] = float(input())
for i in range(n):
    if a[i][i] == 0.0:
        sys.exit('Divide by zero detected')
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        ratio = a[j][i]/a[i][i]
        for k in range(n+1):
            a[j][k] = a[j][k] - ratio * a[i][k]
X[n-1] = a[n-1][n]/a[n-1][n-1]
for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):
    X[i] = a[i][n]
    for j in range(i+1,n):
        X[i] = X[i] - a[i][j]*X[j]
    X[i] = X[i]/a[i][i]
for i in range(n):
    print('X%d = %0.2f' %(i,X[i]), end = ' ')

~~~
## Output:
![gaussian elimination](gaussian.png)


## Result:
Thus the program to find the Gaussian Elimination with partial pivoting of a matrix is written and verified using python programming.
